# Product Landing Page

## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/pod-demo.png)

A mobile first, fully responsive landing page for an app named Pod. The page was built to be fluid and responsive across all viewports; breakpoints were created to strategically compliment the content, and special attention was paid to tablet displays (large height, medium width). A small amount of JavaScript was utilized to create custom email validation for the form.
